 * If n is an odd number, the result is then multiplied by x once again, as the
 * exponent is truncated under the division, and we must therefore account for
 * the remainder. 
 * 
 * The complexity of the algorithm can be determined using mathematical analysis.
 * The exponent that is given to the function is divided by 2. The amount of
 * iterations until 1 is reached is therefore given by ceil(log2(n)). Since
 * the algorithm iterates until 0, we have to use ceil(log2(n)) + 1.
 * We can therefore conclude that in the worst case, the algorithm has
